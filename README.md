# C++ programming course
## Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences

After completing the course the student is capable to learn to use different kind of class libraries and application frameworks.

Contains:
* Console class (input from and output to console)
* String class (stores chars as array)
* Pair class (stores any two classes together)
* List class (stores any objects as double-linked-list)
* Dictionary class (extends List class for loading from and writing to files)

How it all works:
1. String class is used to store single words
2. Pair class is used to store two Strings together as WordPair objects (English and Finnish words)
3. List is created for WordPair objects
4. Dictionary class is used to load and save word lists
5. Search, Insert and Delete functionality is proveded directly by the List class (find, push_back, back, pop_back)
